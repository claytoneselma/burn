        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Provide clear context and specific parameters for your queries. Instead of "help me with code," try "help me write a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key value."</li>
            
            <li><strong>Break Down Complexity:</strong> For complex questions, break them into smaller, manageable parts. This allows each model to focus on specific aspects and provide more targeted insights.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Leverage Threads:</strong> Use follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics. XChan's context awareness in threads enables progressive refinement and exploration.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Specify Format:</strong> If you need responses in a particular format (code, list, essay, etc.), mention it explicitly. This helps XChan tailor its output to your exact needs.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Compare Perspectives:</strong> When dealing with subjective topics, explicitly ask for multiple viewpoints to leverage XChan's multi-model strength.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Iterate and Refine:</strong> Don't hesitate to ask for revisions or alternative approaches. XChan excels at iterative refinement through thread conversations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Provide Examples:</strong> When seeking specific types of content or solutions, providing examples helps XChan understand your expectations better.</li>
            
            <li><strong>State Constraints:</strong> Mention any limitations, requirements, or constraints upfront (word count, technical limitations, audience level, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Response Quality & Synthesis</h3>
        <p>XChan's responses benefit from the combined strengths of three leading AI models through sophisticated synthesis algorithms. The platform doesn't simply concatenate outputs—it intelligently merges insights to create responses that are greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Synthesis Methodology:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consensus Building:</strong> Identifies areas where all models agree, presenting these as high-confidence facts or recommendations</li>
            <li><strong>Diversity Highlighting:</strong> Surfaces unique insights from individual models that add value through alternative perspectives</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> When models disagree, XChan presents multiple viewpoints with context about why differences exist</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Weighting:</strong> Dynamically adjusts model contribution based on query type and historical performance patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Coherence Optimization:</strong> Ensures synthesized responses flow naturally and maintain logical consistency</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This approach helps minimize individual model biases while maximizing the breadth and depth of information provided. Users benefit from more balanced, comprehensive, and reliable responses that capture the nuances of complex topics.</p>

        <h3>Privacy & Data Handling</h3>
        <p>XChan processes conversations through secure channels with strong privacy protections. Understanding how your data is handled is important for informed usage.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Processing:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Public interactions via mentions are visible on the X platform according to standard X privacy settings</li>
            <li>Direct messages remain private between you and the bot, encrypted in transit</li>
            <li>Conversation context is temporarily stored to maintain thread coherence but not permanently logged</li>
            <li>User queries are anonymized when sent to AI model APIs</li>
            <li>No personal identifying information is shared with third-party AI providers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Best Practices for Privacy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid sharing sensitive personal information like passwords, financial details, or private addresses</li>
            <li>Use DMs for queries containing personal context rather than public mentions</li>
            <li>Remember that public mentions are permanently visible on the X platform</li>
            <li>Review X's privacy settings to control who can see your public interactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations & Considerations</h3>
        <p>While XChan provides powerful AI assistance, users should be aware of important limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> Responses are generated by AI and should be verified for critical decisions. XChan provides information and perspectives, not professional advice in specialized fields like medicine or law.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Knowledge Cutoff:</strong> While Grok provides real-time information, ChatGPT and Claude have knowledge cutoff dates. For very recent events, some models may have limitations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> The bot cannot access your personal data, private messages with others, or information not shared in your query. It operates only on information you explicitly provide.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Response Times:</strong> May vary based on platform traffic, API availability, and query complexity. Most responses arrive within seconds, but occasionally delays can occur.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Character Limits:</strong> X's character limits may require responses to be condensed or split into threads. Complex answers might need multiple tweets to fully address.</li>
            
            <li><strong>API Dependencies:</strong> XChan's functionality depends on the availability of external AI model APIs. Service interruptions to Grok, ChatGPT, or Claude can affect response quality or availability.</li>
